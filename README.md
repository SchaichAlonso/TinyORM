TinyORM is a modern ORM library that makes interacting with a database extremely simple.

The code is written in the modern c++20 way and is __heavily__ tested with __3269__ unit and functional tests. Almost all the query builder methods are unit tested. The TinyORM's query builder code and the code which is responsible for obtaining relationships, is tested by functional tests against all supported databases. The code coverage is good enough to guarantee API and behavior compatibility.

### Features Summary

The following list summarizes all the `TinyDrivers` and `TinyMySql` libraries' features. üÜï

 - both, normal and prepared statements are supported
 - TLS/SSL connections using [`MYSQL_OPT_SSL_MODE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/en/mysql-options.html) (verify_ca, verify_identity) üî•
 - setting many other connection options (see [`mysqldriver_p.cpp`](https://github.com/silverqx/TinyORM/blob/main/drivers/mysql/src/orm/drivers/mysql/mysqldriver_p.cpp))
 - building and linking against the [`MariaDB Connector/C`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-connector-c/)
 - transactions
 - re-using the current `SqlQuery` instance to re-execute the same or another query
 - detaching from the result set (associated to release memory)
 - query size, number of affected rows, last inserted ID, testing `isNull()`, ...
 - all __3269 unit tests__ passed üòÆ

The following list fastly summarizes all the `TinyORM` features.

- __simple database connections management__ üß¨
  - database manager that helps with the database connections management
  - `Orm::DB` facade class for nicer and shorter syntax
  - MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and PostgreSQL support for __all__ features üíé
  - multi-threading support üëÄ
  - __SSL__ connections support üîí
- __impressive query builder__ üîß
  - allows passing sub-queries and raw expressions practically everywhere, to column names, values, and to every SQL clause as select, where, joins, group by, having, order by üî•
  - a logical grouping that offers to wrap logical groups in parenthesis
  - chunked results for lower memory footprint ‚ú®
  - raw methods for all SQL clauses
  - all join types (left, right, cross, inner) and also join where clause support ü´§
  - aggregate methods min, max, sum, increment, decrement, ...
  - whereExists and exists methods for an existence queries
  - transactions and pessimistic locking üîí
  - of course, insert, update, and delete SQL clauses support
  - __correct QDateTime time zone__ using the `qt_timezone` connection configuration option üìÖ (returned QDateTime instances will have the correct time zone, and also works for an ORM)
    - this feature allows you to set up the database server time zone to the UTC and all returned QDateTime instances will have the correct UTC time zone
- __clever ORM with all relation types support__ üéâ
  - one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relation types (also inverse relationships) üß®
  - eager and lazy loading with custom select and constraints üöÄ
  - fluent `ModelsCollection` that expose a variety of map / reduce operations that may be chained using an intuitive interface ‚ú®
  - all query builder methods are proxied from the model instances and also from the relation instances back to the query builder ü§Ø (everything that can be called on the query builder can also be called on the model and relation instances)
  - clean active record pattern
  - advanced features like timestamps, touching parent timestamps, __soft deleting__, default models, default model attributes, and attribute casting ü§ì
  - querying relationships existence/absence using the has, whereHas, and hasNested methods (using dot notation for selecting nested relationships _users.posts.comments_)
  - __serializing__ models and collection of models including all nested relations to __JSON__ and converting to vectors and maps ü™°
    - supports controlling a custom date format during serialization
    - supports hiding and appending attributes
- __compiled database migrations and seeders__ üï∫
  - create, update, drop, and rename database tables
  - create, drop, and rename table columns
  - extensive schema builder that allows creating of all possible column types
  - terser syntax for creating foreign keys and foreign key constraints
  - supports creating, and dropping column indexes (primary, unique, fulltext, spatial)
- __the `tom` console application with tab completion for all shells (pwsh, bash, zsh)__ ü•≥
  - scaffolding of models, migrations, and seeders
  - impressive models scaffolding, every feature that is supported by models can be generated using the `tom make:model` cli command
- a huge amount of code is unit tested, currently __3269 unit tests__ ü§Ø
- C++20 only, with all the latest features used like concepts/constraints, ranges, smart pointers (no `new` keyword in the whole code üòé), folding expressions
- qmake and CMake build systems support
  - CMake FetchContent module support ü§ô
- vcpkg support (also the vcpkg port, currently not committed to the vcpkg repository ‚òπÔ∏è)
- it's really fast, you can run 1000 complex queries in 500ms (heavily DB dependant, the PostgreSQL is by far the fastest) ‚åö
- extensive documentation üìÉ
- ...
